**Personalized Diet-Induced Changes in the Gut Microbiome and Breast Cancer Risk**

## üìÅ Repository Description

This repository contains the R code and documentation used to perform the **power analysis** for the IRB-approved research protocol titled:  
**"Personalized diet-induced changes in the gut microbiome and breast cancer risk"** (Protocol ID: 33495).

The study investigates how individualized dietary interventions modulate the gut microbiome in human participants and explores how these changes influence **breast cancer risk** in a preclinical mouse model via **fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)**.

## üéØ Project Objectives

This protocol includes two co-primary endpoints:

1. **Human Endpoint:**  
   Assess changes in gut microbiome composition following personalized dietary interventions.

2. **Preclinical Endpoint:**  
   Evaluate tumor development in mice colonized with microbiota from human donors.

Power analyses were conducted for both endpoints to ensure sufficient sample sizes and statistical validity, targeting a **minimum power of 80%** (Œ≤ = 0.20) and a **significance level of Œ± = 0.05**.
